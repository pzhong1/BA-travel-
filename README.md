## Description

BA Travel is an application that can take the user anywhere by flight or by car.  The application offers flight information, driving directions, and a 5-day weather forecast.

This app takes a minimalist approach to travel planning.  Our goal is to get the user where they need to go in the fewest clicks.



## User Story  

As a traveler, 
I want to see flight information or driving directions, 
so that I can reach my destination.



## Acceptance Criteria  

WHEN a user comes to our application they can enter a location.

WHEN the user clicks ‘Search’ 
THEN the user is taken to the next page.

WHEN the new page loads
THEN the user is given the option to FLY or DRIVE to their destination AND OpenWeatherMap API will present a five day weather forecast for the destination.

WHEN FLY is selected 
THEN a new page will load.

WHEN the page loads, the user will input the three letter airport code 
THEN Amadeus Travel API will retrieve flight information.

WHEN DRIVE is selected 
THEN a new page will load.

WHEN the page loads, the user will input their current location THEN Here API will present driving directions to the desired destination.
