 ## User Story  



## Acceptance Criteria  
WHEN a user comes to our application they can enter a location.  

THEN they are presented with a five day weather forecast for that  
location and a second screen with the options of FLY or DRIVE?  

WHEN FLY is selected a third page will open and Amadeus Travel  
API will present flight options. WHEN drive is selected THEN a  
different third page will use googlemaps api and will present driving  
directions to the selected destination from where the USER is located. 

THEN an additional button will ask the USER would you like to view  
hotels in the area? THEN upon clicking the button Amadeus travel will  
present hotel options for the USER to stay while they are there.
